# Hi, I'm Pachu Chembukave

![Me](/me.jpg)

I'm a software developer currently working at [FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com/). I have many varried interests:

## Programming
* Machine Learning
* Cybersecurity
* Functional Languages
* Web Experiences (WebGL, WebAssembly, WebSockets WebRTC)
* Cloud Deployments & Services
* Games

## Movies & TV
Love watching movies and TV. Probably spend way too much time watching tbh. Not really into franchises/sequals/remakes, prefer new concepts & original ideas. Big plus for visually stimulating cinematography. At some point I'll list my favorites here, but its just so hard to quantify and always changing...

## Reading
I Love reading, scowering for updates on reddit/hackernews/google news. I love keeping up with whats happening and reading new articles about things I didn't know. I also enjoy reading books. I used to read a ton of fantasy/science fiction. Nowadays I'm trying to get more into non-fiction / books with a clear message and purpose.

## Games
I love both playing and making games. I love video games, but the format doesn't matter too much to me, I enjoy board games and sport as well. I don't really like single player games. For me games are only enjoyable as multiplayer. I enjoy interacting with other players and testing myself against them.

I have many more interests, but its too much to get it all down here. Hopefully I will be able to expand this page over time to be more complete.
