When I first started at Mandiant, they had just been bought by Fireeye. Now Kevin Mandia is the CEO. A lot has changed over the years, but many things remain constant. Want to know what life is like working for one of the biggest cybersecurity companies in the world? Well keep reading then!

# You Touch It, You Own It

When I first joined Fireeye, I had just graduated from Virginia Tech. While I had done many part time jobs and internships already, this was my first foray into full time employment. At the same time the team I was joining was going through major changes of their own. A wave of change was resonating throughout the company, as quick, agile startup culture was being eaten away by a corporate merger. Still, I was just happy to be there, working on a backend more complex than I could have ever imagined.

When I first started, I could barely wrap my head around the one app I was given charge of. I would have to constantly pester my more seasoned colleagues, asking hundreds of (probably pretty dumb) questions. However, slowly but surely, I learned more and more apps, adding contributions and fixes all throughout the backend. I started to form a more complete picture in my mind of the sprawling backend; I learned more about process, best practices, and coding conventions; And slowly I evolved from complete n00b, to a seasoned developer.

Then something devastating happened: my manager (the uniting heart of our team), left the company. The effects of this rippled throughout my team. Over the course of the next few months, we saw many people leave our team, and with them, the knowledge of the apps they had written and maintained for years. Suddenly I found myself in a curious position: I was now the “expert” for many of these apps, just by virtue of the fact that I was the last one left at the company that had a commit in the git log. As we slowly rebuilt our team, I was responsible for teaching many engineers—with years more experience than me—all about our backend.

# Some Things Never Change

During my time at Fireeye, a lot has changed. We’ve moved almost all our apps to Docker. We’ve standardized our build process and increased our test coverage. We’ve started making tighter product-service integrations, moving to the cloud, and updating our infrastructure. Yet, like I said, some things never change. We still have random scripts that are key to the function of the backend. We still have integral applications that no one understands or maintains. We have apps we have been trying to retire for years, clinging to life with vice grips that can’t be broken.

Now, some people may berate us, saying this is awful and there is no way a company should be run this way. They may think us to be stupid or lazy, but I feel those people fail to understand the reality of the situation. The truth is, the sprawling unwieldy nature of our backend, comes from its organic, unplanned growth. As developers moved in and out of the fast-paced environment, each left their own mark: a little script here, a key app there, and eventually the sprawling nest of interconnected programs was born. Some may think that they can clean this up, make it all better, but the truth is, business is messy. You may think: “Oh look at how messy this code is. I could do this much better. Wrap it all up in more generic functions. Simplify a lot of this logic.” But the cold truth is, most of those weird oddities, and random deviations in the code were probably built from necessity; because business rarely fits in a clean standardized template. 

# Looking Forward

In the last few years I’ve learned some very valuable lessons:

* Be careful what you touch, as you may end up owning it. So, if you commit a fix to something, be sure to learn as much about it as you can. It may be easier to learn just enough to get it fixed/working, but in the long run, thorough understanding will help you much more.
* Don’t think you can do things better than those before you. It’s good to try, but remember, most things were probably built by smart people, that had a reason for doing it the way they did. Try to understand what their reasoning was, and it can save you tons of wasted effort. But I will concede sometimes it’s just bad lol.
* Sometimes things are too big to fix overnight. This can be daunting. But there is real value from making incremental improvements over a longer period of time. Like the drop of water dripping onto the stone till it finally cracks, persistence is key.
