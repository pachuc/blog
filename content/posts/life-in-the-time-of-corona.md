In the last week the Dow has fallen almost ten percent as the world finally wakes up to the harsh realities of COVID-19. With the sudden plunge of the stock market, many may be wondering about the true seriousness of corona virus; why the stock market is falling now; and whether it will fall further. In this post I would like to try to compile the information about the virus that I have found, and predict how I believe the situation will play out.

# Quelling the Panic

While the world has known about COVID-19 for almost 3 months now, I believe health organizations and professionals have been largely underplaying the seriousness of the situation drastically. Now, while it may seem wrong to misrepresent information to the public, I believe their intentions are largely noble and justified. With a situation as serious as COVID-19, the worst possible case would be to cause a global panic. A global panic, resulting in stopping of business and essential functions of society, would result in the complete halt and breakdown of world organizations and the scientific community. This would mean inability to control the spread, continue research, and produce combative drugs. So while I believe the health organizations have taken the correct action, I also believe that the information the public has received is largely colored by this agenda. This is the lens (read: bias) through which I will be analyzing the situation.

# Containing the Contagion 

After first discovery of COVID-19 in China, the medical community worked rapidly to develop a test to identify infected individuals. The developed PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test kit is based around a similar successful test used for HIV. The CDC took action quickly to distribute these test kits across the globe; however, the accuracy of these tests has proven to be questionable: [“More than one patient has tested positive, only to test negative for the virus a day or two later. However, the virus was detectable yet again three days later.”](https://www.bioworld.com/articles/432813-hhs-declares-public-health-emergency-in-part-because-cdc-test-for-coronavirus-unreliable) Another challenge of the PCR test is that it is both [expensive and hard to distribute](https://hbr.org/2020/02/we-need-a-cheap-way-to-diagnose-coronavirus), which has led to a massive shortage of kits.

Another challenge in stopping the spread of COVID-19 has been our general lack of understanding of the virus. While the cause of the spread is largely thought to be droplet based transmission; [some suspicions around airborne transmission have been raised](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-flu). There is no evidence currently to support airborne transmission; however, previously, in the case of SARS, airborne transmission was discovered as a possibility via aerosolized feces particles. The incubation period of the disease also remains unclear. Originally the incubation period of coronavirus was reported to be 14 days; however, new developments are suggesting that may not be the case. Many quarantines and testing setups were based upon this assumption. As cases continue to grow and the virus continues to spread, this assumption is being called into question. Some scientists have also suggested that COVID-19 is [spreading](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/27/a-single-coronavirus-case-exposes-a-bigger-problem-the-scope-of-undetected-u-s-spread-is-unknown/) through the U.S [undetected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/02/28/coronavirus-live-updates/).

Due to all of the above mentioned issues, the rate of transmission of the coronavirus remains a mystery. While professionals have made educated guesses, there remains disagreement within the medical community. The lack of knowledge around COVID-19 leaves a large uncertainty factor in all the reported estimates.

# The Mortality Factor

To get a good idea of the seriousness of COVID-19, the two closest and best [comparisons are Influenza & SARS](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-is-less-deadly-than-sars-but-that-may-explain-why-its-so-contagious-2020-01-30). Medical professionals have been drawing comparisons to these diseases to understate the seriousness of COVID-19, however, I believe a direct comparison of the [numbers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/) reveals a different story.

COVID-19 has already exceeded SARS in deaths in a shorter period of time, however has a lower mortality rate. This is because COVID-19 spreads much faster than SARS; and so, even with a lower mortality rate, it has killed more people. This is the same math at play when people suggest more people have died from Influenza than COVID-19. Influenza has infected many more people; and so, even with a much lower mortality rate, it has a higher total amount of deaths. For comparison, SARS has an estimated mortality rate of 9.6%, while Influenza has an estimated mortality rate of 0.1%. COVID-19 being a novel phenomenon, is not well understood, and as such, the mortality rates estimated vary greatly. The going estimate currently is 3%; however, when this number is filtered down to only resolved cases, the mortality rate goes up to 8%. Even assuming the rate is closer to 3%, this makes the virus 30 times more deadly than the Flu. In short COVID-19 falls somewhere in-between SARS and Influenza, spreading at what seems like Flu-like rates, while being much more deadly. Now, one caveat in these stats is: when broken down by age, mortality rates for COVID-19 are very top heavy. You have a significantly higher chance to die above the age of 50, as compared to below it; however, this is hardly consoling, given how quickly it spreads, and the fact that most people will have relatives or friends in the deadly age range.

# Final Thoughts

In my opinion, it seems that Corona Virus 2019 is a much more serious situation than most governments are willing to let on. At this time, cures and preventatives are still in a research stage; so, identification and containment of the virus are the best method for reducing the impact of the crisis. This has been largely complicated by the various issues mentioned above.

I believe we have finally reached a tipping point in the cases of COVID-19, where it can no longer be feasibly covered up. The spread has reached all major continents, and is having real impact in financial markets all over the world. At this point, I think it is important to shift strategies, and try to communicate as much information as possible, in a sensible and comprehensive manor. More suppressing of facts will only lead to elevated panic when details finally come to light. There have already been accusations of [disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/22/coronavirus-russia-disinformation-campaign-us-officials) campaigns and manipulation regarding the details of the virus. I think it is time for the scientific community to take control of the narrative, through transparency and clear communication of facts. Our global communication systems are our greatest asset in dealing with a crisis like this. We must put them to use to inform the public and coordinate our actions globally.
