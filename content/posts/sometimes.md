Sometimes, the winds of deafening despair provide a serene comfort.
Like a weighted blanket,
Smothering, yet comforting.
Suffocating and relaxing.
In these moments of the purest silence,
I find the words of my mind
Crystal clear.

Sometimes, the lone bright star, 
shining majestically in the dark void, 
is the most painful sight to behold.
For that sliver of hope,
Is nothing but a tease.
An enticing temptation,
To lift you out of the comfortable tendrils of nihilism.
It is only when you reach for it do you realize;
What hope have you, 
of touching a star?
