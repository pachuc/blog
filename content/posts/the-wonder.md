[The Wonder](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9288822/) is a melancholy tale about the impact of religion on society. The film is entrenched in strong themes and symbolism that is pervasive throughout its runtime: food, religion, blood, and stories. The repetitive scenes, such as the girl saying her prayer; the nurse eating her meals at the inn; or the nurse taking drugs at the inn, all add to the slow and uneasy build up of the movie. 

While the film is well made, and the entire cast gives stellar performances, I have one major criticism of the film: it is too on-the-nose. The commentary on religion is extremely one-sided with very little nuance. All the symbolism and themes of the movie are obvious, rather than subtly integrated. For example, using a Frame Story mechanism to highlight the importance of stories to the plot, with no other tie-in or reference to it, was heavy handed, and poorly executed in my opinion. 

Overall, I thought the movie was fine. It was beautifully filmed, and acted, and achieved a very strong and consistent melancholy tone, which evoked the same feeling in myself. If this is a feeling or vibe that you are looking for, then this movie is highly recommended. Personally, I think the film could have been excellent if there were more layers to the plot, and its themes and ideas were integrated with more nuance.

6.5/10
