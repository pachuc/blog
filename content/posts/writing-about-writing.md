# Why I Started Writing

For a while I’ve been meaning to write, but I just never got around to it. Finally, I put my fingers to keys, and so here we are. I still find it difficult to make time for it, get in the rhythm, and find my flow; however, in the end, it’s always gratifying, and here are some reasons why:

* It helps me organize and distill the swirling typhoon of thoughts in my head. By writing, I can ensure I don’t end up forgetting important ideas and experiences. Codifying my thoughts as words also helps to flush them out. Writing, at least for me, requires thoroughly thinking through my ideas. Going through this process helps refine these passing thoughts and form them into more complete ideas.
* It allows me to document the many things I play with and work on. Over the years I’ve found that I work on a lot of different things, that end up with no tangible result. I’ll spend hours programming something, or playing with code or hardware, but with nothing production worthy. By writing about these things I can document my experience and still get some valuable output from the time spent.
* Finally, I’ve found online writing, tech blogs, guides, etc. to be very useful over the years. If I can provide even a modicum of the same utility I’ve gotten out of these writings, it will be worth investing my time in doing this.

# Choosing Where to Write

When I first decided to write, I considered numerous options from self-hosted to fully managed services. For a hot minute, I very seriously considered writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/). I had read some informative Medium articles recently, and as I was mulling writing in the back of my mind, I wondered if Medium would be a good way to start? Medium offers a lot of obvious benefits. First off one can just start writing. No need to take the time to set up a website, and a domain, etc. Just focus on the words and content. Secondly, it comes with a nice WYSIWYG editor, which would make it even easier to get started writing good content. Finally, Medium markets itself very well as a platform for writing. It entices you with promises of an audience, promotion, community, and even the opportunity to make money! So, with such great promises, and such low barrier to entry, it’s no wonder so many people chose Medium as their platform of choice. 

However, as I dug more into the platform, and reflected on my own experiences with Medium, I quickly decided against it. The first thing I realized was that I was never happy that an article was published on Medium, rather often times I was put off. It’s so aggressive towards readers, constantly popping up a log in modal, restricting the number of articles you can read per day, etc. Medium is very friendly towards content producers, but at the same time, very unfriendly towards consumers. I also realized that the only time I spent browsing Medium, ever, was when I was looking into making an account to write there. Other than that, I always found myself there via links, whether from recommendations or site aggregators. So, while there may be a small set of dedicated Medium browsers looking for good content, I think the majority of people there are just trying to promote and grow their own material. Not really the organic audience you want to try and capture. It also has all the usual pitfalls of algorithm and engagement gaming that most social media sites are entrenched in—which I must admit, I hate. As I did more research, I also [found](why-you-shouldnt-blog-on-medium-.html) [more](https://blog.elementary.io/welcome-to-the-new-blog/) [and](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/why-im-leaving-medium/) [more](https://www.cdevn.com/why-medium-actually-sucks/) [people](https://classicwfl.com/home/medium-sucks-for-your-readers-stop-using-it/) [saying](https://yanngirard.typepad.com/yanns_blog/2015/10/) the same things.

After deciding against Medium, I also looked into some other hosted solutions: [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). These have the benefit of being able to switch to self-hosting. But ultimately, I decided I was going to end up paying for hosting somewhere, so I should pick a tech stack that scales and that I can customize. Plus, as a developer, it just made sense.

So, I had decided to self-host my own website, now I had to choose a tech stack. Since it would be mostly a blog/personal website, static site generation seemed to be the simplest and best answer. I had some previous experience with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but ultimately, I decided on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Jekyll had the advantage of a large community: more integrations, more themes, more support available. However, I see Hugo as the better alternative as it is much faster; I personally prefer Golang to Ruby; and while Hugo may not have as many themes, it has enough good ones, and I hope to one day customize my theme anyway. 

# What to Write

I figured out why I should write, where I should write, and how I should write. As far what I should write about, I'm still working on that. Since I expect this to be a personal blog, the list of topics I can cover I actually quite diverse. From technical topics like programming and security, to more light hearted topics such as my favorite movies. Hopefully the breadth of available topics can keep writing, and hopefully people will keep (start) reading!
